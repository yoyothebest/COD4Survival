In case you create your own variation of the game mode, please make sure to give it a proper title 
that describes its functionality changes and difference from other versions that might come. 
Just please make sure to give credits to SPi and Scillman for the hard work of putting together 
the basic version of it which started it all.

Important: If you make a different mod version of this make sure to rename your new
mod folder with a new and different name. Do NOT release modified versions of this mod with
mod folder named survival_mw3 because there will be conflicts with other versions.

HOW TO USE:
######################################

The source files of the Survival Mode are listed in the SOURCE FILES category.

If you wish you create your own levels for this Survival Mode there are 
some very specific steps that you need to follow in order for everything to function properly.

INSTALL:
First of all to install the source files
copy folders: 

main
raw
mods
map_source
zone_source
source_data
model_export

that came with this this download,
and paste them in your call of duty 4 game directory.
If done properly everything should go where they must.

MAPS INCLUDED:
Only the Well Town example map is included. 
You can create your own template map with the Spi App Template feature
Instead of editing well town which is messy.

After you install you can just compile Welltown and play it.
Again, you can use the Spi App to create a new basic-empty survival map,
and expand upon it to create your own level.

It is HIGHLY recommended to use the SPiApp that came with this download.
Elaborated information about how to use that tool are in the text file of the folder of the app.

However if you don't want to use SPiApp then you will have to work with the standard COD4 Mod tools
to create and organize your own map from scratch which will be way more time consuming and 
will require a lot of file and asset gathering and listing.
That's why I urge you to use SPiApp to make the levels.
It will really make your job so much easier and save you a lot of time. 

For that reason I gave you two Guides below. 
One for the old way, and one for the SpiApp Way.
I will start with the SPiApp way to show you how simple it is.
And if you still want to use the classic tools for it.
A guide for that will be put right afterwards.

SURVIVAL GUIDES:

==== SPiApp TOOLS SURVIVAL GUIDE:=========================================================================

Please make sure you have read and understood the
SPiapp Guide.txt before trying this SPiApp method.

Now if you chose the Classic Mod Tools method you are
already tiered from reading all the details.
But this method here, will clear everything up for you.

Assuming you know how to use SPiApp which is explained 
in the txt file of the app folder, all you have to do
to generate a basic example template survival map
where you can expand upon to create your own survival map
is to Click on NEW MAP in the Compile tab.
Select the Template: survival_mw3
Type a valid map name, for example su_backalley.
Click Create Map.
And DONE!

Now you have a very basic example survival map
where you can expand upon to create your own map!

AS SIMPLE AS THAT!

However you are must still make sure that when you edit the map,
you will stay in the survival prefab ents limits 
that are explained below in the numbered list of ents.
Make sure to read that list, it's very important that you 
know all the details about the radiant ents necessary for 
this survival mode.

Finally, you will have to learn how the color group pathing system works.
And how to place pathnodes, cover nodes and group them in color group triggers.
My youtube tutorials explain the basics. Just note that they're only used
so ally NPCs can follow player around. They use blue color and team allies.
Keep those in mind regarding color groups.

==== CLASSIC MOD TOOLS GUIDE:=========================================================================

Before we start it would be good to read the SOURCE FILES 
category below to get an idea of what files we possess.

Given you installed the source files properly, 
you are now ready to start making your own survival levels.
To make a level of your own you need to know how to design cod4 levels.
I can not teach that to you here. If you know how to make maps, proceed.
It is recommended that if you want to use your map for survival mode
better name it with the (su_) in front of it's actual name.
Example: su_backalley.map
Assuming your map's level design is somewhat ready,
we need to be able to run it in Call of Duty 4 Map in Singleplayer.
Just the design of the map is all we need. Don't bother with script.
If you don't know how to do that you need to follow my tutorials linked all over these files.

Having your map ready, you can start placing down the necessary ents in Radiant.
These ents are all in map_source/survspi/
Let's break down what each one of them is needed for.
And it is VERY IMPORTANT to place down a
specific number of each of those ents 
in the survival map so it functions properly.

Total of 17 Ents need to be EXPLAINED:

1) start_zoom.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed)
This is the player_spawn of the level. If you already have an info_player_start
delete that and use Start_zoom instead. This is also needed for the start zoom in effect.

2) survival_map_center.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
This is necessary for spawnign the AC130 and the UAV and other various settings.
Place that in the aproximate center of your map.

3) armory_weapons.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
This is the weapon armory shop that will exist in the map.

4) armory_equipment.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
This is the equipment armory shop that will exist in the map.

5) armory_airsupport.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
This is the air support armory shop that will exist in the map.

6) enemy_spawns.map ( Minimum 6 Maximum 16 )
This is where enemies will spawn. Put these around the map with sufficient space between them.
but be careful do not post too many or too few of them or else there will be problems or errors.
The limits are clear above.

7) helicopter_ally.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
This is where the ally helicopter will come from.
The heli path is visible with an empty trigger brush.
The helicopter and NPC spawn must be out of the playable map and the path end must 
be touching the edge of the playable map in the appropriate height.

This heli ally prefab has a few more variations which define what kind of teams there will be.
I've included 3 versions. Use ONLY one of them in your map.

Here are the versions:
helicopter_ally (MW2 TaskForce141 - MW3 Sas)
helicopter_ally_cod4_sas_woodland_blackkit (COD4 Sas Woodland - COD4 Blackkit)
helicopter_ally_cod4_woodland (COD4 Marines Woodland - COD4 Sas Woodland)
helicopter_ally_cod4_usmc_blackkit (COD4 Marines Desert - COD4 Blackkit)
helicopter_ally_delta_mw3sas (MW3 Delta - MW3 Sas)

First team is "Task Force" second is "Riot Team".

8) helicopter_jugg1.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
9) helicopter_jugg2.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
10) helicopter_jugg3.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
The three prefabs above are the juggernaut helicopter spawns.
Only one of each must be placed in the map in a similar way that the
ally heli is placed. The heli spawn must be away from the playable map and the 
path end must be touching the edge of your playable map in the appropriate height.

11) helicopter_hind1.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
12) helicopter_hind2.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
The two prefabs above are the enemy attack heli spawns.
The same logic applies to them too with the above helis.
The heli spawn must be away from the playable map and the path end must 
be touching the edge of your playable map in the appropriate height.

13) helicopter_landing_zone.map ( At least 4 of them must be placed. )
This is where transport helis will land their troops.
These must be placed in open areas of your map.
At least 4 of them must exist in your map.
Place them in areas where the ground circular trigger
isnt affected by any props or too many solid objects and walls.
The appropriate height is easy to tell from the shape of the prefab.

14) helicopter_exit_path.map ( At least 4 of them must be placed. )
These are paths that the transport helis will chose to exit the map.
At least 4 of them must be placed. Make sure to place them properly.
The Higher edge is the Start of the path that must touch the edge 
of your playable map in the appropriate prefab height.
And the lower edge is the path end that should be far away from your map

15) helicopter_attack_heli_pos.map ( At least 2 or more of them must be placed. )
These are goal positions that the attack helicopters will use to seek player.
You can experiment with them and place as many of them as you think your map needs
so attack helis seek player with success. The height is not really important in these.

16) helicopter_crash_origin.map ( At least 2 or more of them must be placed. )
These are helicopter crash origins that attack helicopters will go to when they are destroyed.
You can place a variety of those on rooftops, on walls, on open areas and generally
areas where helicopter would be appropriate to crash.
No real limit is set for this. You can be generous when placing these.

17) ending_trigger.map ( Only 1 of this must be placed )
This is just the ending trigger. Place it anywhere you want.
But only ONE must exist in your map.

If your map has the prefab ents properly placed as elaborated above,
then we are ready to move to the final 3 steps.

One last thing we have to do in radiant is set up the NPC paths.
This is going to take quite some time depending on the map's complexity.
You can follow my Spawning and Moving NPCs tutorial in the playlist linked above
to get an understanding of how to do this step.

Assuming you know how to place pathnodes around the map, and how to place
cover nodes around the map, as well as using color groups in areas,
you can now proceed.

It is suggested that you place a rich amount of cover nodes
around various obstacles around your map. 
The NPCs will function way better this way.

Now if you wish your ally NPCs to follow you, you are required to 
set up color group areas with triggers and cover nodes.
My tutorial explains the basic of this method. And frankly it may sound
complicated and hard to beginners but it's the easiest way of telling NPCs to move around the map.
Make sure you only use BLUE color and ALLIES team. Because that's what friendly NPCs work on.
Hope you figure it out.

ALL color group triggers that handle ally NPCs must have 
the targetname of "ally_color_triggs"
Extremely necessary.

Next setting up your map's script file is very easy because
_survspi.gsc handles everything.

Assuming you have a basic gsc script file of your map in raw/maps
you only need to add the following two lines.

maps\_survspi::survspi_init(); // This must be BEFORE maps\_load::main(); 
thread maps\_survspi::survspi_start(); // This must be RIGHT AFTER maps\_load::main(); 

Your script will look something like this:

main()
{
	maps\_survspi::survspi_init();
	maps\_load::main();
	thread maps\_survspi::survspi_start();
}

And as easy as that we are DONE with the script!

One last step we need to do is our map's zone file.
Assuming your map's zone file is auto generated with the mod tools
when we first clicked "Build Fast File"
then all we have to do is edit it,
and add EVERYTHING from the
ZONE FILE LOADING category below.
Just scroll down a bit and you'll see it.
Careful of the note that says that you have to replace
the 4 words YOURMAPNAME with your actual map name
in our previous example it was su_backalley.

We are ready!
Compile BSP, with bsp, light, and paths enabled.
Compile Reflections,
Build Fast File
and if everything went right,
the map will be fully functional with the Survival mode!

######################################
ZONE FILE LOADING.
######################################

Assuming you create survival map 
without the use of templates from SPiApp
then you will need to load the following files 
in your the zone file of your map.

In the long list of asset paths below,
you must replace the word YOURMAPNAME
with your map name after you paste them in your zone file.

DO NOT REPLACE THE TEXT BELOW
REPLACE THEM AFTER YOU PASTED THEM
IN YOUR ZONE FILE ASSET LIST
KEEP THIS AS A TEMPLATE
